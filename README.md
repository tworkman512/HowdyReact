# HowdyReact

###About###

This is a simple greeting app built with Node, Express, and ReactJS. Yes, it is incredibly useless and basic, but hey, it helped me learn some things and we all have to start somewhere. 

###Getting Started###

Clone the repo, install the dependencies and then start up the app by doing the following:

```
	> git clone git@github.com:tworkman512/HowdyReact.git
	> cd HowdyReact
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
